# idm_dump
Dump information from MicroFocus IDM to files

I myself use these to dump information from different servers and diff the result to verify that the same rules, GCVs etc are installed on different test servers.

## policy_rule_dump.py
Basic script to dump policy rules to files.

## idm_dump.py
A more generic dump extracting policies, GCVs and PRD  information.

Also supports dumping multiple servers in the same script.
